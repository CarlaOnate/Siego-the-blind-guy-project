## Obective:
- In this game you are Siego who is the main character and you need to find the keys to get out of the apartment. As the name of the game says 
your are blind so you cannot view the screen while you play. In this game all you need is some headphones and something to cover your eyes.
The way you can find the keys is by walking throw the apartment and listening to your surrounding and at some point you will hear some keys dropping, and to grab them
you have to be in front of them and press the space bar. This game as of this moment is multiplayer meaning that each player has 40s to find the keys. 
The plyaer who finds the keys faster is the one who wins the game. 

## How does it work:
- In this game, to help the player navigate throw the map the sound changes origin, meaning that if the player is standing next to the stove on the right side
then he will hear the stove on the right headphone if the player is on the left side the sound will be on the left headphone and if
the player is looking right at the stove the sound will be on both headphones, this helps the player know where he is and what is around him.
